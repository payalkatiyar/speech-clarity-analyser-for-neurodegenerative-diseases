Week 2 -

Dataset Preparation -
Classify datasets in the structure data-audio-train/test-dysarthric/normal-arraymic/headmic.
"prepare_dataset.py" uses als folder which contains raw data and splits them in a 70:30 ratio of using the audio samples from a headmic(clearer closer audio) and arraymic(distant and vague audio).
The 70:30 split will help in training the model to be more perceptible to noisy audio inputs without taking noise as a parameter for evaluation of clarity scores.
 
Run the "prepare_dataset.py" script once to split the data, if a rerun is still needed remove the directory data/audio, make the directory structure again using - 
mkdir -p data/audio/train/{normal,dysarthric}/{headmic,arraymic}
mkdir -p data/audio/test/{normal,dysarthric}/headmic

then rerun the script.
Week 2 - split the refined dataset efficiently further to be used in training the model optimally.

Week 3 -
do not rerun - clean_audio.py (removes silent files, and trims silences)
